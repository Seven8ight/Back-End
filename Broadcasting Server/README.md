# Broadcasting Server

A server intended to provide communication across all connected clients.

## Setup

To set it up just start up the server
Currently its a command rather than a CLI application

```bash
    npx tsx --watch Main.ts
```

Then to join just do

```bash
    npx tsx --watch ./Application/Client.ts
```

Enter a unique username and then start chatting with any other connected clients
