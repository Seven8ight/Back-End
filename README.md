11. TMDB CLI Application - https://roadmap.sh/projects/tmdb-cli

NB:
Personal tracker contains blog json file that takes up space. Expense tracker api took me a while due to side quests, the UI is garbage but it works at least, will do better in the upcoming projects.

To execute the TMDB CLI application ensure to run

```bash
   npm i -g .
```

first and then execute the app as TMDB --type <choice - popular, top etc
